Rule-based classification projects for calculating potential customer revenues for companies.

1) Rule-Based Classification for Calculating Potential Customer Revenue for a Tourism Company

A tourism company wants to create level-based new sales definitions based on some characteristics of their sales and wants to estimate how much new potential customers can earn for the company based on these new sales definitions. 
For example, the company wants to determine how much a customer from Antalya, who wants to stay at an all-inclusive hotel during a peak season, can potentially earn.
The dataset contains information about the prices of the sales and details about these sales. The dataset consists of records generated for each sales transaction.

2) Rule-Based Classification for Calculating Potential Customer Revenue for a Gaming Company

A gaming company wants to create level-based new customer definitions (personas) based on some characteristics of their customers and estimate how much new potential customers can earn for the company based on these new customer definitions.
